1) Reorder

the other kind are services without a price
this way the service provider (or admin) accept the job then by the description and picture from the client can replay with the price then the client accept the price and can schdule with the service provider or admin
if the service provider or admin cant give the price by the details and picture sent- they will have to schdule a meeting for price offer - to see the job needed to be done- only then during the meeting the service provider or admin can give the price and after the client aproves the price they can schdule to do the job 
after a price offer is sent- the service provider or admin can say if its a service that the client can order again in the same price in the future if yes the client will see the service in service list and can order it for next time without going through the price offer proces


2) Service Provider payment
now if its a service provider
the price hes writting is the price the company needs to pay him
and we need to have a way to see everything the company ows to the service provides- we will pay him by the end of the month by check


3) also when a client order a service- as long as he have a price he can say he wants the service just one time or every x time (every week, two weeks etc)


4) when client order a service and add descripition picture etc- i want him also to be able to add checklists for the workers or service providers
the workers or service providers will have to mark all checklists of clients (as checkboxes) to mark hes seen and done all- before he can click that he finished the job

5) also workers or service provider can report an issue and invite the client to get a service while hes in his property- for exmaple the worker sees an electricity problem take a picuture write the problem on description and select electirion to fix the problem
the client will get a messege from the worker that with description picture and if he accept he can order an electrition (service provider) to fix it

6) its realy important to me that on the admin panned we can see all schdule of all jobs in souch a way we can understand manage or eddit the schdule of the day, week etc

same with payments, reviews and all

7) if its an Airbnb apartment
then on the flow of ordering a service- sould be check in and check out- time



8) now about the payment method
it sould always be credit card by default- the client cant change the payment method- only the company- admin can say for a client that he will pay by check\cash\ money transfer- and than like we can see how much money the company ows to a service provider- we can also see how much money a client ows to the company and then charge it from the client (with our own system)
