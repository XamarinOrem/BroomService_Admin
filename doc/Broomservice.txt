1) I need it in hebrew english and russian for mobile app and web
2) after sign up 
the user need to add and list his propertys
with all of the information needed
than he can select and order a service he needs for each property
types of preperties are
house\apartment
building
car
hotel
yacht
airplain

he can list as manny properties he wants for each kind

so on his menue other than home\bookings\notification\profile

we sould add properties
in properties he can search find and  select the property he needs to order a service

3) now on schdule a service there sould be  an option for the client to select if he wants the service just one time or repetetly once every x time or every selected date
4) another question i have 
if its a service provider the flow is realy good
but if its a worker of the company that does a job i dont want him to see the price the client is paying for that job

5) Also service providers get pay by the job and workers get pay by the hour
So we need to add option for time counter- so the company can see the information of how much to pay for workers or service providers

For the client to see timing of job is not relevant atm..
